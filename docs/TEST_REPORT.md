## Test Report

### 1. Introduction
Our application is mainly divided into three major components:
1.  Frontend
2.  Backend
3.  Database  

Each component requires its own methodology of testing since they focus on different things. These will be elaborated in further detail in the next section.

### 2. Test Strategy
#### Frontend
The focus lies on the correct (re-)rendering of objects as well as the right function calls of the buttons. Hereby, integration and unit tests are crucial when testing the frontend. For the Manual testing is also required, because some visual aspects need to be reviewed by the actual developers.

### 3. Test Plan

### 5. Test Results 
> This section summarizes the results of the testing, including major defects found, their severity, and the steps taken to resolve them. (You may link to the test reports generated by your testing tool.)

### 6. Metrics
> This section provides quantitative data on the testing process, such as the number of defects found, the defect resolution time, and the test coverage achieved.

### 7. Recommendations
